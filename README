ulcompress
==========

The "ultimate" file compressor, even capable of infinite compression
(0-length files).

How to use
==========

This program compresses and uncompresses files.  Its compression ratio
is very near to no compression (a fraction of a bit in average), but
it ALWAYS compresses, so you can ALWAYS get 0-length compressed files
if you compress a sufficient number of times.

Experiment with very small files first (1 or 2 bytes).
Compress a lot of times (billions of times or even more).

Beware: this program will modify your file in-place!  Make a backup!

Usage: ulcompress [-v] -c FILENAME       compress once
       ulcompress      -C 5 FILENAME     compress 5 times
       ulcompress      -D 5 FILENAME     decompress 5 times
       ulcompress      -d FILENAME       decompress once

Example session:

$ echo Hi > file
$ ulcompress -C 9999999 file
Cannot compress that much.
Hint: compressing 748105 time(s) will make a zero-length file.
$ ulcompress -C 748105 file
$ ls -l file
-rw-r--r-- 1 noon noon 0 Oct 16 20:49 file
$ ulcompress -D 748105 file
$ cat file
Hi
$
